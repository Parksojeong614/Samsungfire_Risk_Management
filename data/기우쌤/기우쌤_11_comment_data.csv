23,babyanimals7271,"I'm getting out of control -- I keep following Dara's videos around and saying how much I admire her because I do!

THIS age-related statement is a little trickier. I really like that Dara isn't a little kid anymore. She's in her late 30s, and is a 100% inspiration for people at the same (or later!) stage in life. You don't have to be 17 to make great, relevant music.

Plus, life has thrown some rough times in her path (like the demise of 2NE1) and she can still make happy music like Festival.

It isn't just her music that's great art -- she's made living her life great art. Hope we can all say that someday!
