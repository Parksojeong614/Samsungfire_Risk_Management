1,lilup7227,"I really like Nuxe’s huile prodigieuse too. In France it’s a really classic product that everyone knows, as a child it’s what my mother used to take care of my curly hair, I had really silky soft hair and it was probably thanks to that",0.0,4개월 전
2,AllMyInkHybrid,"Thank you for the recommendations! I will try the nuxe oil first~   I have tried the gucci floral perfume before and I like it too. I usually buy yankee- candles or  ” Klinta”- candles from Sweden. It smells wonderful. My favorite is ”clean cotton” from Yankee, and ”Fig & grape” from Klinta.

I have a recommendation for you: a bath  with magnesium minerals , eucalyptus and lavender! The body absorbs the minerals and it helps your relax   If you don’t have a bath, I recommend lavender oil to relax the senses~",0.0,6개월 전
