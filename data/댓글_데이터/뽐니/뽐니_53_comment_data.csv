0,kamolhengkiatisak1527,"Singha beer was introduced/produced into Thailand about 100 years ago using German recipe. It was highly appreciated by both Thai and expat drinkers. Even though other local brand was introduced one or another  but could not shake Singha's dominance and died away until Thai Beverages, the largest and most dominant liquor producer (mostly rum and white spirit) in Thailand, decided to partner with Carlberg to produce the brand locally to compete with Singha. It also resulted in a failure to challenge Singha. Both sides gradually drifted apart and Carlberg was eventually no longer produced locally. Before the final breakup, Thai Beverages introduced Chang (Elephant) beer in green bottle, which was much cheaper to gain market share from Singha. It was successful in a few years after heavy promotion and discounted price, and became No.1 seller. This was the reason that Carlberg decided to quit the Thai market as it seemed its Thai partner did not care to promote Carlberg anymore after Chang beer was successfully introduced. Singha did not give in and introduced Leo in brown bottle at the same price of Chang and it instantly became a success as well. Now, Chang and Leo are neck and neck, dominating local Thai beer market.",6.0,7개월 전

46,kamolhengkiatisak1527,"Wat Pho is an old temple south of the Grand Palace. It is also known also as the Temple of the Reclining Buddha built by King Rama III in 1832. The King also decreed that traditional Thai massage and traditional medicine be inscribed on stone tablets to deseminate the knowledge to the general public. The famous Thai spa and massage are believed to originate from such stone inscription. King Rama III was also known as Merchant Prince because when he was still a prince he conducted trade with China and asked the ship captain to bring back stone sculptures such as Chinese deities, mythical beasts as stabilizing balance in the ship's belly. These stone sculptures are now commonly seen at Wat Pho, Wat Arun and the Grand Palace. When President Obama had only one day to tour a Thai temple, US Embassy recommended this temple due to its unique architecture, history and beautiful reclining Buddha.",0.0,7개월 전
