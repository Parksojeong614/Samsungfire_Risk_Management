4,seobom,"진짜 볼때마다 환호와 감탄을 하고 갑니다... 늦은 나이에 언니 네일보고 이번 9월부터 네일 아트 학원다니기 시작했어요 ㅜ ㅜ 도구도 없고 도구의 이해도도 없어서 다니기 시작하면서 언니 네일이 얼마나 창의적이고 대단한지 알면 알수록 더 감탄하고 가요.. 정말 좋아해요 ㅜ ㅜ
어쩜 간단한 도구로 이런 색다른 아트를 만들어갈수 있는걸까요 정말 사랑합니다..
늦은 나이지만 언니같은 네일리스트가 되고 싶네요 ㅜ ㅜ",25.0,11개월 전(수정됨)

27,rhondar4063,I liked and subscribed halfway in the moment I seen you did the leaves by molding them with a real leaf. I also love the universal way you used minimal words and got your point across very easily via visual aid. The leaves will hold longer in the refrigerator with a damp cloth in a plastic bag. Have a great weekend. Wonderful job:),0.0,11개월 전

I’ve never heard of clay gel though so I’ll have to see what I can find out about that. 
edit: I see, it’s like sculpting/builder gel. I should have probably guessed that lol. My bad*
I’m assuming the powder at the end is like a holographic or chameleon powder?
